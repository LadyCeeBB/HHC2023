# HHC2023
This is my write-up for the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge (HHC) for 2023.  

At the start, my intent was to participate with the primary goals of getting reacclimated to the Unix environment, exposed to technology tools, and learning new things in this space. In the past, I struggled to carve out sufficient time to do deep dives into these challenges so I didn't set a goal regarding challenges to complete.  When I hit the 50% mark, I considered a stretch goal of publishing my work. 

I'm elated that I successfully completed X of the Y challenges, as well as both of the bonus challenges.  I also found some Easter eggs and other notable mentions.  In addition to hitting my goals (I learned a lot and flagged things I want to explore further), I decided to complete my stretch goal. So that end, here I am. :)

I'm new to using github beyond as a viewer so my approach is to publish my work as PDFs to minimize recreating my notes from Microsoft OneNote. 

You can share your comments with me as I'd love to hear your thoughts on my approach in solving the challenges and readability of my reports.
