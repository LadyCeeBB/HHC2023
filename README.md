# HHC2023
This is my write-up for the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge (HHC) for 2023.  
At the start, my intent was to participate with the primary goals of getting reacclimated to the Unix environment, exposed to technology tools, and learning new things in this space.  Definitely, I met those goals and even my stretch goals of publishing my work in completing more than half of the challenges. 

Also, I'm new to using github beyond as a viewer.  So I decided to publish my HCC work here (a goal added after the deadline to submit our papers).  

I tracked my work in Microsoft OneNote and actually played around with how to lay it out there.  It morphed as I completed challenges, primarily due to my documenting other findings outside of the immediate challenges.  Similarly, I spent some time figuring out how to lay it out here so bear with me as I work through the publication pieces.  

You can share your comments with me as I'd love to hear your thoughts on my approach in solving the challenges and readability of my reports.
